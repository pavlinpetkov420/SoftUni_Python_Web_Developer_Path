Testing - check is the product covers the requirements
Types of testing:
    - Manual
    - Automated
        a. Unit
        b. Integration
        ... an so on

    MANUAL TESTING (MT)
        1. Test the code as a standard user
            -  Go to each page of Web app
            - Test every behabiour and functionallity
        [This happens every time: New feature, fixed bug, changed requirment]
        2. Drawbacks from MT
            - Not repeatable
            - Hard to structure (possible human errors)
            - Require more time and resources

    AUTOMATION TESTING (AT)
        1. AT represent business reqiuirements in code

        Types:
            - Unit
            - Integration
            - Functional (UI / End2End)
            - System test
            - Regression tests
            - So on ...

        2.  ->Done through an automation tool
            ->Higher accuracy
            ->Better reporting capabilities
            ->Increased coverage
            ->Improved bug detection
            ->Increased reusability
            ->Stability

        3. Benefits:
             - automatically repeatable
             - fail as earlyy as possible
             - enable the presentation of business requirments i code
             - reduce the cost of change
             - decrease the number of defects in the code
             - Improve design

    CODE CONVETIONS WHILE TESTING
        1. Less abstract, more concrete
        2. Test specific cases
        3. Tripple A pattern:
            - Arrange
            - Act
            - Assert


    UNIT TESTING
        -> Test individuals components or units of a software
        -> Unit testing is done during the development (coding phase)

        1.Framework - Unit may be individual
         - Function
         - Method
         - Procedure
         - Modules
         - Object
        2. Concepts behind unittest
            - test fixture - setup test environment (system time, system local..)
            - test case - set of test
            - test suite - collection of testcases
